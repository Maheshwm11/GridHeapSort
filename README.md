# GridHeapSort
Heap sort for N*N grids in Java

Heap sort is an in-place but unstable sorthing algorithm. This is its implementation to sort a N * N grid. The integer "compares" allows to check how many actual compares it took to sort the grid. In heap-sort, the average case time complexity is usually O(nlog(n)), where n is the number of elements in the grid (here N^2).
